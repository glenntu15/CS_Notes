## Principles
+ **Encapsulation** -- hides internal structure and only allows access through public functions
+ **Inhearitance** -- Allows child classes to inherit data and behaviors from parent classes
+ **Abstraction** -- Focuises on exposing only the essential functionality of an object
+ **Polymorphism** -- Allows object of different types to be treated as instances of the same basic type
